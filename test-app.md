# Testing the AI Recruiting Dashboard

## How to Test

1. **Start the development server** (if not already running):
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open your browser** and navigate to:
   - http://localhost:3000

3. **Expected behavior**:
   - You should be automatically redirected to `/login`
   - The login page should display with a form

4. **Login with demo credentials**:
   - Email: `admin@airecruiting.com`
   - Password: `password`

5. **After successful login**:
   - You should be redirected to `/dashboard`
   - The dashboard should show with:
     - Sidebar navigation on the left
     - Dashboard metrics and KPIs in the main content area
     - User info in the bottom of the sidebar

6. **Test navigation**:
   - Click on different menu items in the sidebar
   - Each page should load without errors
   - The active menu item should be highlighted

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Clear browser cache and cookies**:
   - Open DevTools (F12)
   - Go to Application tab
   - Clear all site data

2. **Check browser console** for any errors

3. **Verify the server is running** on port 3000

## What was fixed:

1. **Middleware configuration**: Updated to properly handle authentication redirects
2. **Authentication flow**: Fixed cookie/localStorage sync issues
3. **Component structure**: Separated server and client components appropriately
4. **Redirect logic**: Simplified to avoid loops and ensure proper navigation
